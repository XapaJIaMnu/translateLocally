# translateLocally
Fast and secure translation on your local machine with a GUI, powered by marian and Bergamot.

## Downloads

You can download the latest automatic build for Windows, Linux and Mac from the [releases](https://github.com/XapaJIaMnu/translateLocally/releases) github tab or from the [official website](https://translatelocally.com). We also have compatibility builds for Windows and Mac that aim to cover very old hardware and M1.


## Compile from source
Bringing fast and secure machine translation to the masses! To build and run
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j5
./translateLocally
```

Requires `QT>=5 libarchive intel-mkl-static`. We make use of the `QT>=5 network`, `QT>=5 linguisticTool` and `QT>=5 svg` components. Depending on your distro, those may be split in separate package from your QT package (Eg `qt{6/7}-tools-dev`; `qt{5/6}-svg` or `libqt5svg5-dev`). QT6 is fully supported and its use is encouraged. `intel-mkl-static` may be part of `mkl` or `intel-mkl` packages.

### Ubuntu 20.04 build dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y libpcre++-dev qttools5-dev qtbase5-dev libqt5svg5-dev libarchive-dev libpcre2-dev
```

### Ubuntu 22.04 build dependencies:

#### Install MKL for Ubuntu (Any)
```bash
wget -qO- "https://apt.repos.intel.com/intel-gpg-keys/GPG-PUB-KEY-INTEL-SW-PRODUCTS-2019.PUB" | sudo apt-key add -
  sudo sh -c "echo deb https://apt.repos.intel.com/mkl all main > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/intel-mkl.list"
  sudo apt-get update -o Dir::Etc::sourcelist="/etc/apt/sources.list.d/intel-mkl.list"
  sudo apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends intel-mkl-64bit-2020.0-088
```

### Archlinux build dependencies
```
# pacman -S libarchive pcre2 protobuf qt6-base qt6-svg intel-oneapi-mkl
```

## MacOS Build
On MacOS, translateLocally doesn't rely on MKL, but instead on Apple accelerate. If you want to build a portable executable that is able to run on multiple machines, we recommend using Qt's distribution of Qt, as opposed to homebrew's due to issues with [macdeployqt](https://github.com/XapaJIaMnu/translateLocally/issues/69). To produce a `.dmg`do:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . -j3 --target translateLocally-bin translateLocally.dmg
```
Alternatively, if you wish to sign and notarize the `.dmg`for distribution, you may use [macdmg.sh](dist/macdmg.sh)
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j5
../dist/macdmg.sh .
```
Check the script for the environment variables that you need to set if you want to take advantage of signing and notarization.

## Windows Build
On Windows, we recommend using [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) to install all necessary packages and Visual Studio to perform the build.

# Command line interface
translateLocally supports using the command line to perform translations. Example usage:
```bash
./translateLocally --help
Usage: ./translateLocally [options]
A secure translation service that performs translations for you locally, on your own machine.

Options:
  -h, --help                     Displays help on commandline options.
  --help-all                     Displays help including Qt specific options.
  -v, --version                  Displays version information.
  -l, --list-models              List locally installed models.
  -a, --available-models         Connect to the Internet and list available
                                 models. Only shows models that are NOT
                                 installed locally or have a new version
                                 available online.
  -d, --download-model <output>  Connect to the Internet and download a model.
  -r, --remove-model <output>    Remove a model from the local machine. Only
                                 works for models managed with translateLocally.
  -m, --model <model>            Select model for translation.
  -i, --input <input>            Source translation text (or just used stdin).
  -o, --output <output>          Target translation output (or just used
                                 stdout).
```

## Downloading models from CLI
Models can be downloaded from the GUI or the CLI. For the CLI model management you need to:
```bash
$ ./translateLocally -a
Czech-English type: base version: 1; To download do -d cs-en-base
German-English type: base version: 2; To download do -d de-en-base
English-Czech type: base version: 1; To download do -d en-cs-base
English-German type: base version: 2; To download do -d en-de-base
English-Estonian type: tiny version: 1; To download do -d en-et-tiny
Estonian-English type: tiny version: 1; To download do -d et-en-tiny
Icelandic-English type: tiny version: 1; To download do -d is-en-tiny
Norwegian (Bokmal)-English type: tiny version: 1; To download do -d nb-en-tiny
Norwegian (Nynorsk)-English type: tiny version: 1; To download do -d nn-en-tiny

$ ./translateLocally -d en-et-tiny
Downloading English-Estonian type: tiny...
100% [############################################################]
Model downloaded succesffully! You can now invoke it with -m en-et-tiny
```

## Removing models from the CLI
Models can be removed from the GUI or the CLI. For the CLI model removal, you need to:
```bash
./translateLocally -r en-et-tiny
Model English-Estonian type tiny successfully removed.
```

## Listing available models
The avialble models can be listed with `-l`
```bash
./translateLocally -l
Czech-English type: tiny version: 1; To invoke do -m cs-en-tiny
German-English type: tiny version: 2; To invoke do -m de-en-tiny
English-Czech type: tiny version: 1; To invoke do -m en-cs-tiny
English-German type: tiny version: 2; To invoke do -m en-de-tiny
English-Spanish type: tiny version: 1; To invoke do -m en-es-tiny
Spanish-English type: tiny version: 1; To invoke do -m es-en-tiny
```

## Translating a single sentence
Note that customising the translator settings can only be done via the GUI.
```bash
echo "Me gustaria comprar la casa verde" | ./translateLocally -m es-en-tiny
```

## Translating a whole dataset
```bash
sacrebleu -t wmt13 -l en-es --echo ref > /tmp/es.in
./translateLocally -m es-en-tiny -i /tmp/es.in -o /tmp/en.out
```

Note that if you are using the macOS translateLocally.app version, the `-i` and `-o` options are not able to read most files. You can use pipes instead, e.g.
```bash
translateLocally.app/Contents/MacOS/translateLocally -m es-en-tiny < input.txt > output.txt
```

## Pivoting and piping
The command line interface can be used to chain several translation models to achieve pivot translation, for example Spanish to German.
```bash
sacrebleu -t wmt13 -l en-es --echo ref > /tmp/es.in
cat /tmp/es.in | ./translateLocally -m es-en-tiny | ./translateLocally -m en-de-tiny -o /tmp/de.out
```

# NativeMessaging interface
translateLocally can integrate with other applications and browser extensions using [native messaging](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_messaging). This functionality is similar to using pipes on the command line, except that the message format is JSON which allows you to specify options per input fragment, and the translated fragments are returned when they become available as opposed to the input order.

## Limitations
Right now there is a 10MB message limit for incoming messages. This matches the limitations of Firefox. Responses are limited to about 4GB due to the native messaging message format.

## Using NativeMessaging from Python
Start translateLocally in a subprocess with the `-p` option, and pass it messages [formatted as described here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_messaging#app_side) to its stdin. All supported messages are described in the [NativeMsgIface.h](src/cli/NativeMsgIface.h) file.

There is an example, [native_client.py](scripts/native_client.py), that demonstrates how to use translateLocally as an async Python API.

## Using NativeMessaging from browser extensions
Right now, the functionality is only automatically available to Firefox and Chrome.

translateLocally automatically registers itself with Firefox when you start translateLocally in GUI mode. Then you can install the [Firefox translation addon](https://github.com/jelmervdl/firefox-translations/releases). After installation of the addon, go into the addon settings and pick "translateLocally" as translation provider.

### Developing your own browser extension
Due to the way Firefox and Chrome call translateLocally, you will need to add your browser extension id to the translateLocally source code before it is able to accept native messages.

Add your extension id to [constants.h](src/constants.h) and rebuild translateLocally from source. Once you start it in GUI mode, it will re-register itself with support for your extension.

If you want your extension id added to translateLocally permanently, please open an issue or send us a pull request!

# Importing custom models
translateLocally supports importing custom models. translateLocally uses the [Bergamot](https://github.com/browsermt/marian-dev) fork of [marian](https://github.com/marian-nmt/marian-dev). As such, it supports the vast majority marian models out of the box. You can just train your marian model and place it a directory. 
## Basic model import
The directory structure of a translateLocally model looks like this:
```bash
$ tree my-custom-model
my-custom-model/
├── config.intgemm8bitalpha.yml
├── model_info.json
├── model.npz
└── vocab.deen.spm
```
The `config.intgemm8bitalpha.yml` name is hardcoded, and so is `model_info.json`. Everything else could have an arbitrary name. translateLocally will load the model according to the settings specified in `config.intgemm8bitalpha.yml`. These are just normal marian configuration options. `model_info.json` contains metadata about the model:
```bash
$ cat model_info.json 
{
  "modelName": "German-English tiny",
  "shortName": "de-en-tiny",
  "type":      "tiny",
  "src":       "German",
  "trg":       "English",
  "version":   2.0,
  "API":       1.0
}
```
Once the files are in place, tar the model:
```bash
$ tar -czvf my-custom-model.tar.gz my-custom-model
```
And you can import it via the GUI: Open translateLocally and go to **Edit -> Translator Settings -> Languages -> Import model** and navigate to the archive you created. 

## Quantising the model
The process described above will create a model usable by translateLocally, albeit not a very efficient one. In order to create an efficient model we recommend that you quantise the model to 8-bit integers. You can do that by downloading and compiling the [Bergamot](https://github.com/browsermt/marian-dev) fork of marian, and using `marian-conv` to create the quantised model:
```bash
$MARIAN/marian-conv -f input_model.npz -t output_model.bin --gemm-type intgemm8
```
And then changing your configuration `config.intgemm8bitalpha.yml` to point to this new model, as well as appending `gemm-precision: int8shift` to it.

## Further increasing performance
**For best results, we strongly recommend that you use student models.** Instructions on how to create one + scripts can be found [here](https://github.com/browsermt/students/tree/master/train-student) and a detailed video tutorial and explanations are available [here](https://nbogoychev.com/efficient-machine-translation/). Student models are typically at least 8X faster than teacher models such as the transformer-base preset.

You can further achive another 30\%-40\% performance boost if you precompute the quantisation multipliers of the model and you use a lexical shortlist. The process for those is described in details at the Bergamot project's [Github](https://github.com/browsermt/students/tree/master/train-student#5-8-bit-quantization). Remember that you need to use the [Bergamot](https://github.com/browsermt/marian-dev) fork of Marian.

Example script that converts a marian model to the most efficient 8-bit representation can also be found at Bergamot's [Github](https://github.com/browsermt/students/blob/master/esen/esen.student.tiny11/speed.cpu.intgemm8bitalpha.sh).
